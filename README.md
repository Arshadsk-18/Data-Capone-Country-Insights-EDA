🌍 Data Capone: Country Insights EDA
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Data Capone dataset to extract meaningful insights about countries using demographic and political indicators. The analysis focuses on population trends, capital-based comparisons, democracy ranking, regional filtering, political leadership data, and country name patterns.

🎯 Objective

To analyze the Data Capone dataset and generate country-level insights using population, capital, region, democracy rate, political leader information, and text-based country name analysis.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used)

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Key Operations Performed

Identified the highest populated country and its capital

Found the least populated country and its capital

Extracted Top 5 countries with the highest democracy rate

Filtered countries in the Eastern Europe region

Found the political leader of the 2nd highest populated country

Counted countries where the political leader is unknown

Counted how many countries contain "Republic" in their name

Identified the highest populated country in Africa

📊 Key Insights

The dataset highlights major differences between the most and least populated countries.

Democracy rate is highest among a small set of countries.

Region-based filtering helps understand geographical patterns (ex: Eastern Europe).

Missing political leader values reveal incomplete political information in the dataset.

Several countries contain “Republic” in their official names, showing naming trends.

Africa’s most populated country was identified for continent-level comparison.
